# tl-clusters
This repository contains a complete program that obtains acoustic measurements for /tl/ clusters, including voicing, relative intensity, and rise time.

## NB
The functions, in their own right, may be of particular interest. They were designed using the [Parselmouth](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/parselmouth/latest/parselmouth.pdf) and [audiolabel](https://github.com/rsprouse/audiolabel) packages. Refer to Ronald Sprouse's audiolabel repository on Github for further information on how to implement these packages and create dataframes with acoustic measurements.
